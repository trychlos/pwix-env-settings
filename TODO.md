|    1 | 2023- 4-30 | Review PES_VERBOSE_ exports as 'window' variable in a Chrome console shows that these appear to be badly exported |
|      | 2023- 5- 1 | - would it be possible that this would be because this is a server-side package ? |
|      |            |   if yes, it leaves to be explained why constants are declared (though undefined) in client-side... |
|      | 2023- 5-12 | package exports are visible in the client because api.export() defined an export to both side |
|      |            | fixed in v 1.2.3 |
